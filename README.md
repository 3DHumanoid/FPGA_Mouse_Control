Description of Project:
	
	This project used the USB HID Host port on the Basys3 board. This chip has built in PIC24 drivers that can connect to a PS2 type mouse or keyboard. In this project I used this to connect to a mouse to receive data from the mouse. This project also utilizes the 7-segment display on the Basys3 board. 
When you click on the left mouse button and move the mouse around the number on the seven segment display increases. When you click the right mouse button and move the mouse around the number on the seven segment display decreases. Below is a  picture of how the mouse connection to the Basys3 board.
 
      (Mouse Connection to Basys 3)

The Basys 3 manual has further details on how the usb and PS2 mouse connect. The mouse connection is a little more complicated than the PS2 keyboard connection because the mouse is an Inout signal. Meaning that there can be data sent to the mouse as well as data received from the mouse. 
The mouse knows when to send and receive data through two wires the PS2 Clock and the PS2 Data. When the mouse is ready to send data it will drop the clock line low and then drop the data line low. After this it waits 100 microseconds and then raises the clock line. Once the clock line is raised then it sends 3 packets of 11 bits.

Conclusion:
	
	This project was a little more difficult than I anticipated. The hardest part was figuring out how to get the timing right to initialize the mouse and tell it to start sending information. My original plan was to be able to manipulate the seven-segment display to display the different values that the mouse was sending. Including the x velocity, y velocity, and a count. I ended up just doing the count as I was unable to separate the information. 
	As of functionality although the program did not meet all the requirements it does function the way it is supposed to with the code that is there. Below is a video attachment showcasing the functionality of the project.
